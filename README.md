# transaction-fee
A simple python script to calculate the price change required to cover transaction fees given a certain purchase volume of stocks. 

I created this because I wanted a convenient tool to know the price difference in a stock I would need to cover for my transaction fees. 

#PREREQUISITES
You need to have this installed on your computer.
1. Python3 

#HOW TO USE
1. Clone this repository
2. Locate the repository in your command line.
3. $fee.py YOUR_PURCHASE_VOLUME    
     eg. fee.py 500   if you are buying 500 stocks.
4. The result will be printed out 

#FURTHER STEPS
The transaction fee is hard coded as a constant because it is the transaction fee of my stock company. 
You may change it for your needs. It can also by added as an argument in the future.
